Zend Debugger Safari Toolbar
============================

This project's goals are to develop a Safari Extension to provide similar
functionality to the Zend Toolbar for Firefox and MSIE.  It will support
the initiation of debugging and profiling sessions, and may grow to feature
other useful debugging tools.
